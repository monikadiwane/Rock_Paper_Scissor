# Rock_Paper_Scissor
Rock paper scissors  is a hand game originating in China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

Rules of RPS:
Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
