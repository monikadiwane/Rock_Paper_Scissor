# Rock_Paper_Scissor
Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating in China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

### Rules of RPS
Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple. It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:

* Rock wins against scissors. 
* Scissors win against paper. 
*	Paper wins against rock.
